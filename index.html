			<h1>I'm Ken Beatty Jr., an IT professional with a strong desire to start my own business and solve important issues within my community.
			</h1>
			<p>The reason I published this github page is to keep you informed on some of the creative ideas I come up with and if you are interested in coding, I will use my respositories to post code for you to use or modify for free. Just so that you are aware, some links will redirect you to my blog page where I'm free to be more creative and offer different types of content. Thank you for stopping by.
